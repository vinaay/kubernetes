# Deamonset
A DaemonSet defines Pods that provide node-local facilities. These might be fundamental to the operation of your cluster, such as a networking helper tool, or be part of an add-on.


Some typical uses of a DaemonSet are:
* running a cluster storage daemon on every node
* running a logs collection daemon on every node
* running a node monitoring daemon on every node
